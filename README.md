# Family Tree Explorer

A beautiful digital interface for your family tree that allows you to navigate your network of family relationships.

## 🥅 Motivation 

**👤 AG**: I would like an app that helps me get insight into my network of family relationships. Since I have a large family, it would be wonderful to have a digital interface to navigate those relationships and store important notes about our relationships without having that data at risk of being sold to third-parties or compromised. 

## 👁️ Vision 

A mobile and desktop application that allows users to build their family tree by adding relationships as notes in their family net worth. Users can add photos, dates for important occasions, contact information, and additional notes to help them regain the context of their relationship with distant relatives. 
 
## ⚙️ Implementation

### Platforms and Frameworks

This app will exist on mobile and desktop devices, so using the web would be an excellent MVP choice. I recommend using the Quasar or Nuxt frameworks for this app because both are capable of generating progressive web apps. Quasar would be more favorable if we prioritize a native android version of the app, which I think we do. 

### Data Storage

Users will have the choice of storing their data locally on their devices, on our secure public parse servers for a monthly donation, or on their self hosted servers through the Docker backend image we will provide.
